            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the
            existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so
            uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8
            billion years ago.

            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to
            understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
            should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what
            might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
            in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
            itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing
            the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
            prodigiously violent instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would
            solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
            and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would
            iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were
            not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
            ocean. “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
            the page and drew a double box around it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
            hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
            cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
            led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
            Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
            so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
            colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct. Inflation has been the
            workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr.
            Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.

            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
            over.
